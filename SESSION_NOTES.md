## 👤 User Working Style

### Preferences:
- **Hands-on collaboration** - Prefers working together in active sessions
- **Real-time testing** - Tests on actual mobile devices during development
- **Practical focus** - Wants features that work well, not just look good
- **User-centric** - Thinks from user perspective ("if I were using this...")

### Decision-Making:
- **Open to suggestions** - Asks "what would you suggest as a user?"
- **Quality over speed** - Willing to iterate until it's right (e.g., Budget Manager UI took 3 iterations)
- **Practical naming** - Changed from "SpendWise" to "Budgetly" after discussion
- **Production-minded** - Already thinking about Supabase + deployment

### Session Style:
- **Multiple short sessions** preferred (2-4 hours each)
- **Active through the day** - Plans to work tomorrow with frequent check-ins
- **Tests immediately** - Runs builds, tests on mobile network
- **Asks clarifying questions** - "Shouldn't both lists be merged?"

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Why These Choices:

1. **Next.js 15 + Turbopack** - Fastest dev experience, built-in optimizations
2. **localStorage First** - Quick MVP, will migrate to Supabase for production
3. **Indian Rupees (INR)** - User's primary currency, will add multi-currency
4. **Slate Color Scheme** - User rejected "childish" purple-pink gradients
5. **Full-width Layout** - User requested, removed all max-w-7xl constraints
6. **2-column Budget Grid** - User requested, better than stacked full-width cards
7. **Network Access (-H 0.0.0.0)** - For mobile testing on local network

### Design Principles:
- **Mobile-first** - All components optimized for 320px+
- **Touch-friendly** - Minimum 44px tap targets
- **Professional** - Clean, modern, not flashy
- **Accessible** - Proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed
- **Fast** - Minimal bundle size, optimized builds

## 🎨 Design System

### Design Philosophy:
- **MOBILE-FIRST & MOBILE-ONLY** - Primary focus on mobile web, desktop is secondary/deprecated
- **VIBRANT & BOLD** - Make users go "WOW!"
- **Eye-catching** - Use bold gradients, shadows, and animations
- **Modern** - Glassmorphism, gradients, and smooth transitions
- **Engaging** - Interactive hover effects and visual feedback
- **Touch-optimized** - Minimum 44px touch targets, mobile gestures

### Colors:
- **Primary Gradients:** Indigo → Purple → Pink (vibrant multi-color)
- **Accent Gradients:** Emerald → Teal → Cyan, Violet → Purple → Fuchsia
- **Card Backgrounds:** White/90 with backdrop-blur for glassmorphic effect
- **Status:** Red (over budget), Yellow (near limit), Green (on track)

### Typography:
- **H1:** 2xl-4xl font-extrabold with gradient text
- **H2:** xl-3xl font-extrabold (often with gradients)
- **H3:** lg-2xl font-bold
- **Body:** sm/base with medium/semibold weights

### Buttons:
- **Primary CTA:** Multi-color gradients (indigo-purple-pink) with shadow-xl, hover:scale-105
- **Secondary:** Glassmorphic with border, hover effects
- **Danger:** Red gradient with shadow

### Effects:
- **Shadows:** shadow-xl, shadow-2xl, shadow-3xl for depth
- **Transforms:** hover:scale-105, hover:-translate-y-1/2
- **Backdrop:** backdrop-blur-sm/md for glassmorphism
- **Gradients:** Multi-stop gradients (from-via-to pattern)

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Mobile:** < 640px (base styles)
- **Tablet (sm:):** ≥ 640px
- **Desktop (md:):** ≥ 768px
- **Large (lg:):** ≥ 1024px

## 💡 Important Notes for Claude

### User Expectations:
- **Be proactive** - Suggest improvements from user perspective
- **Test builds** - Always run `npm run build` after major changes
- **Mobile-first** - Test on actual devices, not just browser devtools
- **Explain changes** - User wants to understand what and why

### Communication Style:
- **Concise** - User prefers brief summaries over long explanations
- **Action-oriented** - Focus on what's next, not what's done
- **Visual examples** - Show code snippets when discussing changes
- **Realistic estimates** - User appreciates honest time estimates

### Don't Do:
- ❌ Don't add emojis to code files (only in UI if explicitly requested)
- ❌ Don't create documentation files proactively
- ❌ Don't make major decisions without asking
- ❌ Don't skip testing after changes
- ❌ **Don't commit/deploy for every single change** - batch them every 1-2 hours or when user requests

### Always Do:
- ✅ Update TODO list as items are completed
- ✅ Run build after significant changes
- ✅ Test mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Keep code clean and well-commented
- ✅ Ask before major architectural changes
- ✅ **Design for WOW factor** - vibrant, bold, eye-catching UI
- ✅ **Batch commits** - collect changes and push every 1-2 hours or on request

#### 5. ✅ Empty States
- **Status:** ALREADY IMPLEMENTED EVERYWHERE
- **Details:**
  - **Dashboard:** "Welcome to Monetly!" with CTA button
  - **Expenses:** Smart distinction (no expenses vs no filtered results)
  - **Budgets:** "No category budgets set yet"
  - **Recurring:** "No recurring expenses yet"

#### 📊 Session Efficiency:
- **Model Used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (best coding model, same price as 3.5/4)
- **Token Usage:** ~83K/200K (41% of budget)
- **Tasks Completed:** 6/6 P0 tasks
- **Time:** Single focused session (~2 hours)
- **Build Status:** ✅ All tests passed

#### 🎯 Model Selection Discussion:
User asked about using **Haiku** to save tokens. Recommendation: **STAY WITH SONNET 4.5**

**Why?**
- Same price as Sonnet 3.5 and 4 ($3/$15 per million tokens)
- Best reasoning and architecture understanding
- Perfect for complex TypeScript/React apps like Monetly
- Haiku would struggle with multi-file refactoring and state management

**Token Optimization Tips:**
1. Start fresh sessions for new features
2. Be more specific in requests (avoid "show me options")
3. Don't ask for detailed summaries mid-session
4. Skip creating preview HTML files
5. Use `/clear` when switching major tasks
