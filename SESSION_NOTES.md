## 👤 User Working Style

### Preferences:
- **Hands-on collaboration** - Prefers working together in active sessions
- **Real-time testing** - Tests on actual mobile devices during development
- **Practical focus** - Wants features that work well, not just look good
- **User-centric** - Thinks from user perspective ("if I were using this...")

### Decision-Making:
- **Open to suggestions** - Asks "what would you suggest as a user?"
- **Quality over speed** - Willing to iterate until it's right (e.g., Budget Manager UI took 3 iterations)
- **Practical naming** - Changed from "SpendWise" to "Budgetly" after discussion
- **Production-minded** - Already thinking about Supabase + deployment

### Session Style:
- **Multiple short sessions** preferred (2-4 hours each)
- **Active through the day** - Plans to work tomorrow with frequent check-ins
- **Tests immediately** - Runs builds, tests on mobile network
- **Asks clarifying questions** - "Shouldn't both lists be merged?"

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Why These Choices:

1. **Next.js 15 + Turbopack** - Fastest dev experience, built-in optimizations
2. **localStorage First** - Quick MVP, will migrate to Supabase for production
3. **Indian Rupees (INR)** - User's primary currency, will add multi-currency
4. **Slate Color Scheme** - User rejected "childish" purple-pink gradients
5. **Full-width Layout** - User requested, removed all max-w-7xl constraints
6. **2-column Budget Grid** - User requested, better than stacked full-width cards
7. **Network Access (-H 0.0.0.0)** - For mobile testing on local network

### Design Principles:
- **Mobile-first** - All components optimized for 320px+
- **Touch-friendly** - Minimum 44px tap targets
- **Professional** - Clean, modern, not flashy
- **Accessible** - Proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed
- **Fast** - Minimal bundle size, optimized builds

## 💡 Important Notes for Claude

### User Expectations:
- **Be proactive** - Suggest improvements from user perspective
- **Test builds** - Always run `npm run build` after major changes
- **Mobile-first** - Test on actual devices, not just browser devtools
- **Explain changes** - User wants to understand what and why

### Communication Style:
- **Concise** - User prefers brief summaries over long explanations
- **Action-oriented** - Focus on what's next, not what's done
- **Visual examples** - Show code snippets when discussing changes
- **Realistic estimates** - User appreciates honest time estimates

### Don't Do:
- ❌ Don't add emojis to code files (only in UI if explicitly requested)
- ❌ Don't create documentation files proactively
- ❌ Don't make major decisions without asking
- ❌ Don't skip testing after changes

### Always Do:
- ✅ Update TODO list as items are completed
- ✅ Run build after significant changes
- ✅ Test mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Keep code clean and well-commented
- ✅ Ask before major architectural changes
