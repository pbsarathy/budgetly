## 🎯 OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### 3. Authentication Rate Limits (Optional)
**Status:** ⚠️ RECOMMENDED (Not critical for launch)

**Why Optional:**
- Google OAuth has its own rate limiting
- Client-side throttling is already active
- Only needed if you see auth abuse

**How to Enable (2 minutes):**
1. Dashboard → Settings → Authentication → Rate Limits
2. Set:
   - Email rate limit: 5-10 per hour
   - Password reset: 5 per hour

**Priority:** LOW (can do later)

### 4. Connection Pooling (Optional Check)
**Status:** ⚠️ CHECK IF ISSUES ARISE

**Default Settings:**
- Pool mode: Transaction
- Pool size: 15
- Usually pre-configured by Supabase

**When to Check:**
- If you see "too many connections" errors
- If app becomes slow under load

**Priority:** LOW (only if needed)
