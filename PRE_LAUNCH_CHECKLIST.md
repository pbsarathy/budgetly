# Pre-Launch Security Checklist

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Do These BEFORE Sharing URL (5 minutes)

### 1. Fix Supabase Anonymous Access (2 minutes)
**Risk:** Anonymous users could potentially read data if RLS has gaps

**Action:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/netothdiyhjeiyvxwqbx
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste contents of `supabase-security-fix.sql`
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify output shows "REVOKE" commands succeeded

**File:** `supabase-security-fix.sql` (already created)

---

### 2. Configure Rate Limiting (3 minutes)
**Risk:** Abusive users could spam API calls → high Supabase bills

**Action:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Authentication
2. Configure:
   - **Email rate limit:** 5 per hour
   - **SMS rate limit:** 5 per hour (if enabled)
3. Go to Settings → Database → Connection Pooling
4. Verify:
   - **Pool mode:** Transaction
   - **Pool size:** 15 (default)

**Reference:** See `RATE_LIMITING_SETUP.md` for full guide

## 🟢 DONE - Already Implemented

✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)** - Users can only see their own data
✅ **Google OAuth** - Secure authentication
✅ **Input Sanitization** - XSS prevention
✅ **Content Security Policy** - Prevents code injection
✅ **Secure ID Generation** - Cryptographically secure UUIDs

## 🟡 OPTIONAL - Can Do Later

### 1. Enable Supabase Email Confirmations (Optional)
- Settings → Authentication → Email Confirmations
- Prevents fake email signups

### 2. Add Domain Whitelist (If needed)
- Settings → Authentication → Site URL
- Restrict which domains can authenticate

### 3. Enable 2FA for Your Supabase Account
- Your Supabase account → Security Settings
- Protects against account takeover

3. **Database Size:** Should grow slowly (< 10 MB for 10 users)
4. **Error Logs:** Dashboard → Logs → API (check for unusual errors)

**Set up alerts:**
- Dashboard → Settings → Billing → Usage Alerts
- Alert at 80% of free tier quota
